    <p>
        My name is Zachary Crittenden (most people call me Zach), I'm currently studying Software Engineering
        as my major and I was born and raised in Rexburg Idaho not too far away from campus.
        For my hobbies I love playing board games and video games, with my recent endeavor being to complete
        The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I also like to play trading card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic The Gathering.
        I've been a member my whole life and faithfully served a Full-time mission in the Utah, Salt Lake City Headquarters Mission.
        For me, the things I enjoy about BYU-I are, it being an affordable education as well as being a school that is close to home so that
        I can keep travel simple.
        Im taking this class as a part of my major, but im sure this will help to improve my skills in designing product and improving it to
        fit the needs of clients as well as improving on my programming skills in general.
        I look forward to learning and improving with you all.
