                <p>The positions that are available for application are: Fire Safety Student, Fire Safety Student Lead, and Fire Safety Hazmat.</p>

                <h3>Q6: What are the different responsibilities for each job?</h3>
                <p>in short terms, the Fire Safety Student position performs weekly and monthly inspections on the school's fire suppression systems, the hazmat position assists the student position with their routes and also performs maintenance on fire extinguishers, and the student ead position acts as a supervisor to the other positions in addition to doing their own inspection route.</p>
                <h4>Q7: What differences can be seen between the different positions such as hours, pay or work schedules?</h4>
                <p>Aside from the different responsibilities and pay ranges seen above, there arent any other differences between the jobs as you can decide your own schedule for how many hours you work each week.</p>
                <h5>Q8: What is the availability of each position and how soon could I start working should I apply?</h5>
                <p>Availability for open positions can change rather infrequently, so check the BYUI job boards to see if any of our positions are available. Should you get hired you can begin working approximately a week after you get hired. </p>
